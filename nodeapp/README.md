# ToDoList-TheNetNinja
This is a repository which contains a basic node web api. The project was created by following the tutorial, in order to have quick access of a functional (hopefully) working version.

The tutorial is availabe here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-7RQ46RgxU&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gcy9lrvMJ75z9maRw4byYp

Steps for getting started:

1) download and install node (in case you haven't already)
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2) open a comander tool (the standard console, or cmder.exe or whatever)

3) download the code drom my repository

4) navigate to the code in your terminal (in windows the command is: cd \project_path\)

5) (recommended but not required) install nodemon using this command: npm install -g nodemon
        Since you are specifing the -g parameter, you will install it globally so there is no need to install it later
        Nodemon restarts your application everytime you change a file automatcally. 
        More details about nodemon here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon
        
6) run the following commands. Below you may find additional snack-exlanations, you should not copy them. Do not copy the ">" character at the begining of the command. It is just for refference

> npm-init
- intialize the project in your folder
> npm install express -save
> npm install ejs -save
> npm install body-parser -save

7) Run your application. Make sure that on your terminal, you are in the folder of your application. Run the command bellow on your commander:
> nodemon app
- app is the name of the file which is the entry point of your application
